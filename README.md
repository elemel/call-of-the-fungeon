# Call of the Fungeon

> Below an underground sky<br>
> With a calling to go far and wide<br>
> I have wandered through the chambers<br>
> And across the withered lines<br>
> As a keeper of my temper<br>
> And the favors of a stranger<br>
> For as long as I remember<br>
> Traversing the tunnels of time
