# Afterworld

You have ascended to demigod-hood. You keep the magic map as a memory, granting memory-mapped input and output. Standard streams of consciousness connect this world to the next, mediated by the reader and writer tiles (marked `?` and `!`).

Reading from position `~0` (the same as `-1`) will input a byte from the standard input stream. Writing to position `~1` (the same as `-2`) will output a byte to the standard output stream, while position `~2` (the same as `-3`) will output to the standard error stream.

You are compelled to build a dungeon that prints "Hello, World!".
