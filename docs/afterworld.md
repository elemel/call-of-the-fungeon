## Afterworld

As you leave the last dungeon, an invisible choir sings, and you are bathed in radiance. A voice booms: "Well done, mortal!"

You have ascended to demigod-hood. You decide to keep the magic map as a memory, granting it memory-mapped input and output. Standard streams of consciousness connect this world to the next, mediated by the reader and writer tiles (marked `?` and `!`).

Reading from address `-1` will input a byte from the standard input stream. Writing to address `-2` will output a byte to the standard output stream, while writing to address `-3` will output to the standard error stream.

You are compelled to build a dungeon that prints "Hello, World!".
